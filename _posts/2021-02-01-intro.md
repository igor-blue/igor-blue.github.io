# Is this a good time to start a new cyber security blog?

I have been working in cybersecurity for quite some time, but have always been afraid of writing publicly about my work: afraid of being publicly rediculed for my work, afraid of my english proficiency and afraid in general.

When I finally got the curage to start the North Korean blog thing happened, litterally a half hour before starting, throwing me way down. 

But finally I decided to go anyway.

I'll be posting a lot of my backlog in the next few weeks, including: the Intel PC boot process, intel uCode stuff, expereicnes as a blue teamer.

Lets hope someone somewhere ever reads these words.

Too-doo-loo,
Igor
