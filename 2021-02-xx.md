While I prepare the next blog post on GPU security and a blog post on Microcode, and this time make sure I don't have so many spelling mistakes, its time for a blog post coming from my work.

I'd like to thank the company that contracted me and wished to remain nameless for permitting me to publish this with minor adjustments to maintain their anonimity.
