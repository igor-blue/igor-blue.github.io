<meta name="description" content="In 2018 I was contracted to help a large organization with a very distributed and remote structure. One of the things that I found was that the organization does not have a strict policy regarding the creation, storage and lifecycle of SSH keys.  I decided to look into this issue in general, so in Feb 2019 wrote a crawler that looked for SSH keys around the web - public repos, s3 bucket with bad permissions, data dumps from companies and so on.  From this I got 4807 keys. Next I wrote a small python script that tried the SSH keys - just autenticate and close the connection, without opening any channels as to not actually access the target systems which would be illegal.  I managed to authenticate into 221 hosts, 5 were FreeBSD, 1 was MacOS, 3 were Linux on ARM64, and the rest were Linux x64. This means I have 221 working keys found on the web and no way to notify their owners they should change their keys.  General interesting statistics:          Of the 4807 keys 966 were malformed and 1036 were encrypted (20%). Of the 1036 encrypted I could break 88 passwords using dictionaries and an additional 41 passwords using John-the-ripper on a 3-year old 8-core Xeon workstation after a month of brute-forcing.
